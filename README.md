## About This Configuration üñ•Ô∏è
<p align="justify">
I had been using NeoVim with <a href="https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim">Astro</a> configuration for a long time, which was great, But I decided to write my own config, To get started, I learned the Lua programming language, I read NeoVim's documentation over time, and added everything I think is interesting to this configuration.<br>
I try to write all the necessary codes in the form of one file and put together comments for each section to help people who have just got to know NeoVim and want to write their own configuration, Additionally, I will make sure to update this repository regularly.

## Installation üîß

### Have dependencies
<p align="justify">
Before you start, you need to install a number of basic requirements like git, gcc, make, unzip, and of course nvim itself, this tool is generally available on Linux and Mac explanations by default, but in Windows you have to install them.<br>
Moreover, as a recommendation, for a better user experience, be sure to choose a good terminal emulator along with a suitable font. I am currently using the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code">Cascadia Code</a> myself.
